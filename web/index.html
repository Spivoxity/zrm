<H1>The Z Notation: a reference manual</H1>

<P>Copyright &copy; J. M. Spivey, 1988, 1992, 2001.

<P>The Z Reference Manual has now been allowed to go out of print by
the publisher, Prentice Hall, but they have kindly returned the
copyright to me, so I can make the full text available here.</P> 
<P>Please note that I have <B>not</B> placed the copyright of this
work in the public domain. Nevertheless, I freely grant permission to
make copies of the whole work for any purpose except direct commercial
gain. I retain all other rights, including but not limited to the
right to make translations and derivative works, and the right to make
extracts and copies of parts of the work.  Fair quotation is permitted
according to usual scholarly conventions.</P> 
<P>I've provided the text in two forms: as LaTeX input that is
convenient for quotations, and as a PostScript file convenient for
viewing online or
printing on a 600dpi printer. The LaTeX form consists of a single file
of text (in which I've manually inserted the automatically generated
table of contents, index, etc.), and a style file for LaTeX 2.09. It
doesn't depend on other files of LaTeX input, but does need the font
<TT>oxsz10</TT> that is distributed with the fuzz type-checker. When
the book was first produced, I made enlarged camera-ready copy that
was reduced by about 20% before printing, and that is the form
reproduced here. This form has the body text in 12pt type, and each
page fits nicely on A4 or 8-1/2 x 11 paper. To reproduce the layout of
the printed book, you'll need to process the LaTeX form, after
uncommenting the line near the start of <TT>zrm.tex</TT> that says
"<TT>\mag=833</TT>".</P> 

<P>(September 2001) I've added an Acrobat version of the text too, and
refreshed the PostScript by using a more recent version of <TT>dvips</TT>.</P>
